# Cortana Server Browser
An XBMC script that shows how many players are logged into Insignia and XLink Kai, which games are being played, and upcoming events.

## Features:
- See XLink Kai and Insignia matches in an instant with a friendly, easy-to-use pop-up window!
- Comes with "Insignia Connection Test", a utility which makes sure your DNS is correctly set to Insignia's.

## Bugs: 
- You tell me.

## To Do (100%):
- Add more useful utilities.
- Add "Insignia News" button.
- Add "XLink Kai News" button.
- Optimize RAM usage? (as it uses approx. 4-5MB when launching).

## To Do (Maybe):
- Add a way to launch games via the server browser? (Would be cool, but VERY complicated)
- Restore some lost XLink Kai functionality (ie; joining matches, checking friends lists, etc.)
