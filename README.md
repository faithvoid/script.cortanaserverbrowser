# Cortana Server Browser
An XBMC script that shows how many players are logged into Insignia and XLink Kai, which games are being played, and upcoming events. Made as part of "JX 720 - Insignia Edition", but can be used as a standalone script perfectly.

## Features:
- See XLink Kai and Insignia matches in an instant with a friendly, easy-to-use pop-up window!
- Comes with "Insignia Connection Test", a utility which makes sure your DNS is correctly set to Insignia's.
- Toast (pop-up) notifications for new Insignia sessions, which can be enabled/disabled in the Insignia Settings menu! Now you'll never have to worry about missing a match!

## Bugs: 
- You tell me.

## To Do (100%):
- Add more useful utilities.
- Add XLink Kai matchmaking(?)
- Add "Insignia News" button.
- Add "XLink Kai News" button.
- Optimize RAM usage? (as it uses approx. 4-5MB when launching).

## To Do (Maybe):
- Add a way to launch games via the server browser? (Would be cool, but VERY complicated)
- Restore some lost XLink Kai functionality (ie; joining matches, checking friends lists, etc.)
